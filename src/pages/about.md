Hi there! I'm a Product Manager, currently based in Houston, Texas, though I'm originally from Massachusetts. I've lived all over the place though--New York, San Francisco, Charlottesville, even South America for a while. I have a BA in English from Williams College. I also attended University of Virginia School of Law but left after one year to pursue her interests in technology and startups. 

I have certifications in Full Stack Web Development from General Assembly, and Product Management from the Product School.

I have experience working at two high-growth startups based in San Francisco: Side (real estate) and Enlitic (medical AI). I now work as a Product Manager at SecureDocs, based in sunny Santa Barbara.

When I'm not working, I love love hanging out with my mini Aussie, Jude. I also like to ride my bike, run, lift weights, write and read (serously--I read 200 books in 2020 [if you count audiobooks :)], hack away on side projects like this blog, and nerding out on the LSAT (Law School Admission Test). I know, it's weird. But it's a really fun test (she swears!).
